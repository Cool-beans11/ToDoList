Yello, this is just a simple Calendar/todo list app for your scheduling needs, there are still certain aspects to buff out, such as limiting inputs and stuff, but other than that, I feel its alright. On Linux, the color contrasts are a little horrible, but on windows it looks better. Its affects like only two kinds of buttons.
To open the app, you might need to configure paths for the conn, tickIcon,crossIcon, and stylesheet(at the end of the code) variables to wherever you downloaded it in and then just run ToDoList V2 from the folder its located in.
Thanks
