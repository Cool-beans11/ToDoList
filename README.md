Yello, this is just a simple Calendar/todo list app for your scheduling needs, there are still certain aspects to buff out, such as limiting inputs and stuff, but other than that, I feel its alright.
To open the app, just run ToDoList V2 from the folder its located in, not changing its location, because of the pathing inside the code itself.
Thanks
